# Char-RNN

*This repository is used to predict next characters from sample text, similar to [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) and serves as a demo to show how to take advantage of [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/) to monitor training and optimize neural networks.*

## Introduction

A workflow from prototyping to fine-tuning neural networks has been detailed in this post (FUTURE LINK TO INSERT).

This repository contains support material by solving the Char-RNN problem, for which we want to predict next characters from previously read text.

## Usage

Dependencies can be installed through `requirements.txt`.

The following files are present:

- `notebook - char-RNNN.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook use to prototype our solution ;
- `train.py` is a script to run several experiments and log them on W&B.

The runs and reports can be found on W&B project page (FUTURE LINK TO INSERT).
